# AI-Powered Slogan Generation 
*A unified journey from GRU to GPT-2 to RAG-based Generative AI systems.*

---

## 📜 Overview

**GenSlog** is a comprehensive AI project that demonstrates the **evolution of slogan generation systems** — from traditional deep learning models to advanced **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architectures.

It consists of **three stages**, each representing a significant milestone in the development of Generative AI:

| Stage | Model | Type | Key Feature |
|-------|--------|------|--------------|
| **1️⃣** | GRU Model | RNN | Sequential text generation |
| **2️⃣** | GPT-2 + LoRA | Transformer | Fine-tuned creative generation |
| **3️⃣** | RAG Model | Hybrid (Retrieval + Generation) | Grounded, explainable, and ethical AI |
